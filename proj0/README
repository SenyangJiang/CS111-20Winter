Included files:
	 1.lab0.c: source code for this project
	 2.Makefile: This makefile supports four targets:
	 	   (default): used to compile the source code to a program named lab0
		   check: do smoke-test
		   clean: delete all files created by Makefile
		   dist: build the distribution tarball
	 3.backtrace.png: snapshot that shows segfault and associated stack-trace
	 4.breakpoint.png: snapshot that shows a breakpoint at the bad assignment and variable inspection to comfirm the pointer is indeed NULL

Smoke-test cases in the check target:
1. Standard input and output
2. Redirect input and output
3. Unrecognized argument
4. Missing argument for an option
5. Nonexistent input file
6. Write to an output file without write permission
7. Catch the forced segmentation fault
